# General

## Before finding a solution

1) Make sure to understand the problem by listing:
- Inputs
- Outputs (what do we search)
- Constraints

2) Draw examples

## Comparator implementation to order two integers

Ordering, min-heap: (a, b) -> a - b

Reverse ordering, max-heap: (a, b) -> b - a

## Different ways for two intervals to relate to each other

7 ways:
1) a and b do not overlap
2) a and b overlap, b ends after a
3) a completely overlaps b
4) a and b overlap, a ends after b
5) b completely overlaps a
6) a and b do no overlap
7) a and b are equals
