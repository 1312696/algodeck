## Overview

Algo Deck is an **open-source collection of +200 algorithmic cards**.

It helps you preparing and succeeding in your **algorithm & data structure interview**.

The topics covered are the following:
- [Array](array.md): reversing an array, finding a pivot, handling a dynamic array, etc.  
- [Bit](bit.md): operators, bit manipulation, etc.
- [Complexity](complexity.md): algorithm & data structures complexity
- [Dynamic Programming](dynamicprogramming.md): dynamic programming concept
- [Encoding](encoding.md): encoding theory
- [General](general.md): general knowledge including how to approach a problem or testing a first solution
- [Graph](graph.md): A*, Dijkstra, BFS vs DFS, cycles detection, topological sort, etc.
- [Greedy](greedy.md): greedy algorithms concepts
- [Hash Table](hashtable.md): hashtable data structure
- [Heap](heap.md): heap data structure including min-heap/max heap, binary heap use cases, etc.
- [Linked List](linkedlist.md): linked list data structure, how to get the middle element, iterate over two lists, doubly linked list, etc.
- [Math](match.md): discrete math
- [Queue](queue.md): queue data structure
- [Recursion](recursion.md): recursion concepts
- [Sort](sort.md): sort algorithms including concepts, complexity, use cases, etc.
- [Stack](stack.md): stack data structure
- [String](string.md): string permutation, rotation, rabin-karp substring search, etc.
- [Technique](technique.md): most important techniques to master to solve algorithmic problems including greedy techniques, runner, sliding window, etc.
- [Tree](tree.md): binary tree use cases, binary search tree, 2-3 tree, red-black tree, use cases, etc. 

## Anki Deck

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a free software (Windows/Mac/Linux/iPhone/Android) which makes remembering things easy. It utilizes spaced repetition which is a proven technique to increase the rate of memorization:

> The single biggest change that Anki brings about is that it means memory is no longer a haphazard event, to be left to chance. Rather, it guarantees I will remember something, with minimal effort. That is, Anki makes memory a choice.

Michael A. Nielsen, "Augmenting Long-term Memory"

Thus, using Anki is a great way to prepare your algorithm & data structure interview. 

The **Anki version** (an Anki clone of the cards available here) is available for $12.99:
